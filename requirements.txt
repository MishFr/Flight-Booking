# Flight Booking Platform Installation Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the full-stack flight booking platform, 
which includes a Django/DRF backend and a React frontend. 
The system features user registration with admin approval, 
flight search and booking, and real-time flight status updates.

1. Prerequisites
2. Backend Setup (Django/DRF)
3. Frontend Setup (React)
4. Configuration and Running the Application
5. Additional Notes

 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

 System Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Node.js 14+ and npm/yarn  
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database (recommended)  
- Redis (optional, for real-time updates)  
- Email server credentials (for notification emails)  

 Software Dependencies
- Git  
- Virtual environment tools (venv or conda) 
 

 2. Backend Setup (Django/DRF)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

	bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-booking-backend.git
cd flight-booking-backend


 Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

	bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Step 3: Install Dependencies

	bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


 Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with your database and email credentials:
env

DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name
DATABASE_USER=your_db_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key


 Step 5: Run Migrations
 bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


 Step 6: Create a Superuser
 bash
python manage.py createsuperuser


 Step 7: Run the Development Server
 bash
python manage.py runserver


The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.



 3. Frontend Setup (React)

 Step 1: Clone the Repository
 bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-booking-frontend.git
cd flight-booking-frontend


 Step 2: Install Dependencies
 bash
npm install
  or
yarn install


 Step 3: Configure API Endpoints
Create a `.env` file or update configuration files to set the backend API URL:
 env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000


 Step 4: Run the React Development Server
 bash
npm start
 or
yarn start


The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.



 4. Configuration and Running the Application

 User Registration & Approval
- Register as a new user via the registration page.
- Admin reviews and approves users through the admin dashboard at `/admin/`.
- Upon approval, users receive an email notification.

 Flight Search & Booking
- Log in with an approved account.
- Search for flights, filter results, and book flights.
- View "My Trips" to manage bookings and check flight statuses.

 Admin Management
- Use the admin dashboard to approve/reject users and manage flights.



 5. Additional Notes
- Ensure Redis or Celery is configured for email notifications.
- For real-time flight status updates, integrate with services like AirLabs or OpenSky Network.
- Customize environment variables for production deployment.
- Regularly update dependencies and keep security best practices in mind.
